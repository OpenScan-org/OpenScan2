# OpenScan2 - 3D Scanner

Please take a look at the current [CHANGELOG](./docs/changelog.md)

This is not the official OpenScan repository. This is a fork of [Thomas Megel](https://github.com/OpenScanEu) work but completly user-centric. Openscan is great in both software and hardware an
and Thomas has done a great job. But openscan has those things that:
* Users hate and complain continually and there is no one fixing nor acepting fixes/features
* The workflow has ups and downs and some interactions feel buggy.
The aim of this project is to tackle both weaknesses. COnvert this to a pleasant experience fro the burning of the image to the exporting of the model from the scanner.
